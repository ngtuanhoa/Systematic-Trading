# Systematic-Trading

About this repository:

The notebooks in this repository are meant to serve as comprehensive building blocks for establishing an algorithmic trading system. 
 
A number of sample trading strategies are included, along with methodologies to determine their robustness. Walk-Forward Analysis is one such well known technique, while Combinatorial Purged Cross Validation is a newer and more  rigorous methodology. Another useful and important concept is Meta Labelling, which predicts the probability of individual winning trades. All three techniques are utilized here to help improve the rigor of the systematic trading research process. 

Even though the methodologies presented in these notebooks can always be fine-tuned further, they are sophisticated enough to provide rigorous backtesting of any algorithmic trading strategy. After looking through this repository, one should gain an understanding of how algorithmic trading startegies are programmed and backtested. Identifying such strategies can simply be a matter of adapting algorithms found in research journals or trading websites; the aim of these notebooks is to determine a strategy's profitability and robustness. The final step of live trading a strategy should be merely trivial rewriting of a few lines of code in the Zipline version of the strategy.
